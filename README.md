# MFWM Manager Hiring Interview - Bug Challenge

## Overview
`user-dashboard.tsx` contains a simplified React component for our system's user dashboard, which allows an admin to see users in the system. There are two API calls on the page.
- Load all users.
- Load user details when a user is clicked.

## The Problem
You receive the following information from bug reports, and are the first to start digging in.

- Intermittent failure where user gets stuck in loading screen when they try to load their dashboard
  - User is not seeing any evidence of an error.
- Reports are widespread across all users, showing this is not a one-off issue.

## The Task
Given that you are the engineering manager of the team...
1. How would you track down the issue, given the code provided? Feel free to point out both syntactical and architectural issues with the code.
2. How would you give feedback to the team/developer who put this code into production?
